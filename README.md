_So this is a project that I have no idea how far will go. Honestly, it could die with just wireframes to show._

I learn the best through practice. So when I first learnt adversarial search for Intro to AI, I struggled with minimax and alpha beta pruning. That is, until I actually did some questions and built an understanding through making mistakes and finding out why they were mistakes. The problem was that actual questions and answers were limited: this app addresses this by generating practice questions and answers. Additionally, it provides a way to check the answers for questions from past year papers. Since I worked on adversarial search for my AI project over the past semester, this was a natural application of that experience.

## Wireframing

Iâ€™ve opted with material design as a design language for its ubiquity. I was heavily inspired by the resources featured in this [medium post](https://medium.com/@kamushken/material-design-for-desktop-cdb74ce54a04); the designs showcase the sheer power of material design beyond web apps with intentionally simple user interfaces.
