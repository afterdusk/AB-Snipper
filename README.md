_So this is a project that I have no idea how far will go. Honestly, it could die with just wireframes to show._

I learn the best through practice. So when I first learnt adversarial search for Intro to AI, I struggled with minimax and alpha beta pruning until I actually did some questions and built an understanding through a process of making mistakes and finding out why they were mistakes. The problem was that actual questions and answers were limited. This app is supposed to help people like me verify answers of past year papers and do additional practice.

Since I worked on adversarial search for my AI project over the past semester, this was a natural application of that experience. And as I worked with JavaFX (to an extent) to create a desktop application, that was the environment and platform I initially chose. I am exploring using react instead; a web app would greatly improve accessibility and visibility (this would be an easy decision if I wasn't poo at JS).

## Current Stage: Wireframing
Iâ€™ve opted with material design as a design language for of its ubiquity. I was heavily inspired by the resources featured in this [medium post](https://medium.com/@kamushken/material-design-for-desktop-cdb74ce54a04); the designs showcase the sheer power of material design beyond web apps with intentionally simple user interfaces.
